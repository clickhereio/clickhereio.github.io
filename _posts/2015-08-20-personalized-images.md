<p>According to Dale Carnegie, every person's favorite word is their own name.  He also says that,</p>

<blockquote>
	<strong><em>“Using someone's name is a great way to get people to like you and see things your way.”</em></strong>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn’t that why you use email marketing in the first place?  We’re trying to establish a relationship (get people to like you) and encourage them to purchase products or services (see thing your way).</p>

<p>You can easily make things personal in your email by using your subscribers’ names.  This allows you to become more involved with them almost immediately.  It helps you establish a more focused and relevant approach to your email marketing strategy.   Beyond that, you will enjoy higher click-through rates, resulting in a higher ROI (return on investment) through increased conversions.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it’s a chore to actually figure out ways to use someone’s name in an email.  Especially considering that once you use their name once, it’s almost overkill if you use it over and over in your email text.  It becomes annoying at that point.
</p>

<p>That’s why it’s becoming more popular to use personalized images!  This is an approach to use someone’s name in a text overlay on top of an image.  Unfortunately, when using this technique, you may be challenged to find use-cases which achieve the goal of increasing engagement.</p>

<p class="red-text">(<strong>Note:</strong> At the bottom of this post, we’re offering a <strong>free collection</strong> of sample images and fonts for you to easily use.  Start increasing engagement for your own email campaigns!)</p>

<p>The way it works is that you use tags or variables that will include your subscribers’ names.  Check with your email service provider to learn about the tags they make available and how to use them.  Then, use those tags as part of the text to place over your images.</p>

<p>This post should serve as a catalyst to inspire your imagination when deciding how to use personalized images.  Below, you will find several effective ideas to personalize the images you use in your emails.</p>

<h2>Greetings</h2>
<p>What’s the first thing you usually use in any personal letter you’ve written?  Exactly!  Your recipient’s name:  “Dear Mike,” or “Dear Susan,” right?  You can expertly grab your email subscribers attention by spicing up your greeting with a nice header image with their name as a text overlay.  Once you’ve connected with them on a personal level like that, you can be sure that they’ll read the rest of your email.

<h2>Mock Tickets For Events or Webinars</h2>
<p>Instead of begging and pleading your audience to attend your next event, - not really beg and plead, but, you know, convincingly use copy to encourage them ;-) - it can be much more compelling to SHOW them that their ticket has been ‘printed’ already.  Use their name on the ticket to personalize it even further. Imagine how dramatically your register and attend rates will increase!</p>

<h2>Inspirational Quotes</h2>
<p>One of the most shared types of content on social media is a quote that brings an emotion to life.  Have you noticed quotes and mimes on Facebook that have a high number of shares?  The reason is because quotes are great forms of expression that many people can quickly relate to.  Use someone’s name above the quote on an image, and they can’t help but feel as if you are referring to them personally!</p>

<h2>Speech Bubbles</h2>
<p>This can be an excellent way to capture your audience’s attention and make them feel as if you are talking directly to them.  You could use a picture of a person (yourself or a well-known figure in your market) and include your personalized text in a speech bubble to make it seem as if that person is talking.  Your audience will pay close attention!</p>

<h2>Holiday Wishes</h2>
<p>Tradition and religious beliefs cause people to have an inherent desire to take part in holidays.  As an email marketing professional, you should include these celebrations as part of your strategy.  A simple holiday wish inside of an email goes a long way to ensuring your audience feels like you care about them.  Using their name on personalized holiday-themed images will do even more to make them feel special!  Holiday special offers will perform much better when you begin the conversation this way.</p>
