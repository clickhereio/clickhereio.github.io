<p>Every single email service provides CTR (Click-Through-Rate) analytics.  Ever wonder why? </p>
<p>Obviously, CTR is the single most important factor that determines the success of your email campaign.  Without knowing your Click-Through Rate, you have no idea how effective your emails are performing.</p>
<p>In email campaigns, “Calls-To-Action” are directly responsible for determining CTR. Using higher converting Calls-To-Action inside of your email is more of art than science. A well crafted Call-To-Action may bring more conversion to your emails; and good news is that it is not as hard as you might think to build one.</p>
<p>This post will mainly focus on button-based Calls-To-Action, but there are many different types of elements that can be used inside of your emails as well.</p>
<p class="red-text">(<strong>Note:</strong> Look for “<strong>Everyday Bulletproof Email Template</strong>”, we’ve created for you at the end of this post!)</p>
<p>A great email marketer once said,</p>
<blockquote>
<strong><em>“If you want people to click, use buttons.”</em></strong>
</blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of case studies on the topic. <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/4275/buttons-email-marketing-campaigns">Campaign Monitor</a>, for example, got a 28% increase on Click-Throughs when they A/B tested emails with and without buttons.</p>
<p>To make things easy, here are the key factors that are important in building higher converting Calls-To-Action:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use “Bulletproof Buttons”</li>
<li>Decide on placement</li>
<li>Make it standout</li>
<li>Keep it concise</li>
<li>Avoid multiple call to actions</li>
<li>Offer value at low or no cost</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Use “Bulletproof Buttons”</strong></h2>
<p>According to a research by <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/gmail-data-analysis-reveals-image-blocking-affects-43-of-emails">Litmus</a>, 43% of all Gmail users view emails with images off. This shows the importance of using a button without images as your Call-To-Action. At same time, your button should be visually pleasing.</p>
<p>This means you should use HTML based buttons. With very little know-how, you can achieve really nice looking buttons.</p>

<p>Just make sure they are not based on images, or no one may see them!</p>

<h2><strong>Decide on placement</strong></h2>
<p>Calls-To-Action button placement is very important. According to a research conducted by <a href="https://canopylabs.com/blog/optimizing-e-mail-click-rates-how-to-structure-a-call-to-action">Canopylabs</a>, the best place to place your button is at the very bottom of your email, immediately after pitching your message. When they changed the placement of button from “right” to “bottom”, it increased the performance by 143%.</p>
<p>Bottom placement makes it very easy for your prospect to take an immediate action after reading your message.</p>
<h2><strong>Make it standout</strong></h2>
<p>Design the email so the invitation to take action truly emerges. Examine the illustration underneath.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">

<span class="caption text-muted">Example of a button inside an email template</span>
</p>

<p>Notice how I used spacing on the top and bottom of the button. I also made it center aligned. These small tweaks make the button standout from the rest of email content and allow readers to see the action button clearly.</p>
<h2><strong>Keep it concise</strong></h2>
<p>Don’t explain the action you want your subscriber to take in too long of a phrase. Keep it simple, short and concise. For example instead of saying “Click here to get the offer”, simply say “Get the offer”.</p>
<p>That being said, don’t make the action too vague, either.  Pretend you are your reader...what action would you want to take?  Use that as your Call-To-Action button text!</p>
<p>Just remember that long text in buttons may decrease font size on mobile screens so they may look weird and loose the focus of your users.</p>
<h2><strong>Avoid multiple call to actions</strong></h2>
<p>Decision making should not be hard for your user. Don't burden them with multiple actions per email. Stick to <em>one call to action per email</em>.</p>
<p>Don’t take this to mean that you should only use one Call-To-Action in your email, period.  Just limit all of your Calls-To-Action to one action that you want your reader to take!</p>
<p><strong>Bad Example: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Browse Products</li>
<li>Check It Out (A single product)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Good Example:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>...get this offer before midnight today. (A link within email text)</li>
<li>Get Offer Now (Button text)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the bad example: first we offer a way to “Browse Products” and then we ask them to check one of our products. That throws mixed signal to our subscriber and they may not do either thing.  While in the good example, we are using different phrases which are consistent with the one action we want them to take.</p>
<h2><strong>Offer value at low or no cost</strong></h2>
<p>“For every call to action in an email, there is an implied psychological calculus cost in the mind of the customer (value vs cost).” - Marketing Experiments researchers.</p>
<p>These masters of split-testing tested different calls-to-action against their own tweaked versions. Their tweaked results are amazing and show immense increase in performance:</p>
<p>“Find your solution” vs “Learn More”: 77% increase</p>
<p>“Subscribe &amp; Save” vs “View Subscription Options”: +181% increase</p>
<p>“Get Started” vs “See How Sermo Works”: +104% increase</p>
<p>This study tells that we should avoid selling anything but the click within our emails.  All you're trying to do is take your subscribers to a landing page.  Let that landing page do the selling! This strategy allows us to give value to our readers at low or no cost in return for the click, which is really all we should be trying to achieve in our emails.</p>
